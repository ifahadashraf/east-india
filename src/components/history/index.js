                          we reinvested our earnings and became an independent exporter and retailer of tea across

                          decline and eventual fall including the first industrial revolution the world had seen. This
                          was followed by the Indian rebellion & start of the British Raj which led to the abolishment
                          of our primary buyer and bringing our exports to a halt. Consecutively the company faced
                          falling demand due to the growing demand for Chinese Tea accompanied with opium.</p>
